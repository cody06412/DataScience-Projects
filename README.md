Analyzing data from the Drug Discovery sector using Python tools, such as Machine Learning.

### Class 01 (03/05/2021)
Using the Pandas library, I analyzed the available data and completed the proposed challenges.

### Class 02 (05/04/2021)
Using the Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries, I analyzed the available data and generated visualization graphs.

### Class 03 (05/05/2021)
Using the Seaborn and Numpy libraries, I analyzed the available data, using scatter and correlation graphs.

### Class 04 (05/06/2021)
Using the Pandas merge function, we linked two dataframes and created new columns for visualization, which was done through graphs and consolidated data.

### Class 05 (05/07/2021)
Using Sklearn and RandomForest, we seek to use Machine Learning for prediction. However, in this data, we achieved low levels of accuracy with the models used (60% ~ 65%), something that is not acceptable when talking about pharmaceuticals.
